# Overview

Hazzlo is a full-stack web application that connects clients with verified professionals in the Dominican Republic. The platform serves as a marketplace where users can find and hire professionals across various service categories including beauty, technology, home services, automotive, education, health, events, and cleaning. The application features user authentication, professional profiles, service listings, real-time messaging, booking systems, admin management, comprehensive notification system, and a complete live chat support system with moderator authentication and management.

## Recent Development: Friendly URLs and Professional Profile Enhancement

The platform now features a comprehensive friendly URL system for professional profiles:

### Friendly URL System
- **Format**: Professional URLs now use format `/professional/[initials]-[5numbers]` (e.g., `/professional/ag-84729`)
- **Automatic Generation**: Slugs are automatically generated when creating new professional profiles
- **Backward Compatibility**: All routes accept both traditional UUIDs and new friendly slugs
- **Complete Integration**: All professional card components and navigation links use friendly URLs
- **Database Schema**: Added `slug` column to professionals table with unique constraint

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend Routes**: All professional-related API endpoints (`/api/professionals/:id`, `/api/professionals/:id/reviews`, etc.) now resolve both UUID IDs and friendly slugs
- **Frontend Components**: Updated all professional card components to generate friendly URLs automatically
- **Utility Functions**: Created comprehensive URL generation utilities for consistent link creation
- **Chat Integration**: Chat URLs also support friendly slugs (e.g., `/chat?professional=ag-84729`)

### Live Chat Support System with Automatic System Messages

A comprehensive live chat support system has been implemented with:
- Separate moderator authentication system (different from Users table)
- Admin dashboard integration for moderator credential management
- Real-time chat functionality between users and moderators
- Floating chat widget for users when they have active support chats
- Moderator dashboard for managing and responding to support requests
- Complete API infrastructure for chat operations
- **Automatic system messages**: Users receive "Estas a la espera de un agente" when creating chats and "Tu situaci√≥n ha sido escalada" when chats are escalated
- **System message styling**: Centered messages with distinctive colors - blue for informational, orange for warnings

This system allows users to initiate live support chats from the /ayuda page, moderators to manage these chats through /modsupply, and administrators to manage moderator credentials through /admin/credenciales. The system now provides immediate feedback to users through automated system messages that appear with distinct visual styling.
